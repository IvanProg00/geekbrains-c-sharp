# Task 11

Write a program that displays numbers from 1 to 100. At the same time, instead of
numbers that are multiples of three, the program should output the word "Fizz",
and instead of numbers that are multiples of five, the word "Buzz". If the number
is a multiple of both 3 and 5, then the program should output the word
"FizzBuzz".
