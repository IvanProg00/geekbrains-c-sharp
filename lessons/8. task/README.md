# Task 8

Write a program that will take two numbers as input and output whether the second
number is a multiple of the first. If the number 2 is not a multiple of the
number 1, then the program outputs the remainder of the division.

## Example

- 34, 5 -> not a multiple, reminder is 4
- 16, 4 -> a multiple
