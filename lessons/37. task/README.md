# Task 37

Create a frequency dictionary of elements of a two-dimensional array. The
frequency dictionary contains information about how many times an input data
element occurs. Without using a dictionary.

  - 0 occurs 2 times
  - 1 occurs 1 times
  - 2 occurs 1 times
  - 8 occurs 1 times
  - 9 occurs 3 times

- ```plain
  1, 2, 3
  4, 6, 1
  2, 1, 6
  ```

  - 1 occurs 3 times
  - 2 occurs 2 times
  - 3 occurs 1 times
  - 4 occurs 1 times
  - 6 occurs 2 times
