# Task 20

Write a program that takes the positions of an element in a two-dimensional array
as input, and returns the value of this element or an indication that there is no
such element.

## Example

- ```plain
  1 4 7 2
  5 9 2 3
  8 4 2 4
  ```

  [1,7] -> there is no element for such an index.
